There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  > FlyCheap - Keep the money in your pocket.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > FlyCheap helps frequent flyers minimize the cost of flying by tracking flight prices and sending notifications when prices decrease.

## Summary ##
  > FlyCheap tracks the ticket price of flights you're interested, or perhaps, the flights you've already purchased tickets for, in real time.  When a ticket price decreases below the price you paid or the price you last saw, FlyCheap sends you a notification to alert you of the new improved price!  Never pay more for airline tickets than your fellow passengers again!  With FlyCheap, you keep the money in your pocket.

## Problem ##
  > The cost of airline tickets changes with respect to time and ticket sales.  There are numerous strategies available to attempt to make a purchase at the optimal time, but in reality, these strategies rely on a speculation rather than data.  To the dismay of the customer, when you search for airline tickets it's only possible to see a ticket price instantaneously; you cannot see the price of a ticket six hours ago, and you cannot see the price six hours from now.  Thus, it is impossible to know the ideal moment to purchase a ticket.  Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to track these prices and be notified when the cost of a refundable ticket you purchased has decreased?  Why should you pay more than the other passengers on your flight?  

## Solution ##
  > FlyCheap scrapes ticket price data from airline company websites and tracks the changes between them over time.  Further, it allows users to add flights to their own list of flights they are watching and notifies them if that price decreases.
